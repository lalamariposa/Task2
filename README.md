# Task2

Created a proposal called ProposalContract. Inside the contract there is a struct called Proposal. This struct contains the title, description of the proposal as well as the number of votes that approved, rejected or passed. In addition we can see the limit at which the proposal ends. Also we can see the current state and if the proposal is active or not. 

After the struct there is a mapping where we store all the proposals.
